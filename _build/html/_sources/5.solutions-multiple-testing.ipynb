    "# Solutions to the Multiple Testing Problem\n",
    "As mentioned at the end of the previous section, the multiple testing problem presents a large barrier to using the approach we have discussed so far. Luckily, there are some solutions available. In this section we will discuss the three main approaches you will need when working with `SPM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution 1: A Stricter Threshold\n",
    "The first approach we might consider is to simply use a stricter threshold than 5%. Typically, in imaging, the most liberal threshold we can get away with is $p < 0.001$. By using this threshold, we reduce the number of false positive down to a worst-case scenario of 0.1% of the voxels. For an image of 100,000 voxels, this would mean 1,000 false positives, for an image of 50,000 voxels this would mean 500 false positives and so on. Although this is still not great, it is nowhere near as bad as using the traditional 5% threshold. The advantage is that this will still retain good sensitivity, because we know we should also be seeing the majority of true effects as well. This is exemplified in {numref}`poldrack-uncorr-thresh-again-fig`, repeated from the previous section. Although there are lots of results outside the yellow circle, importantly we have identified the majority of true positives inside the circle as well.\n",

    "Visualisation of thresholding an image that contains true activations (within the circle) and noise (outside the circle) using $p < 0.10$. Notice that, despite the false-positives, the sensitivity for detecting effects *within* the circle is very high.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution 2: Control the Family-wise Error (FWE)\n",
    "An alternative to a stricter threshold is to try and control the FWER directly. By doing so, we can limit the possibility of any false positives. If we control the FWER at 5% it means that there is only a 5% chance of any false positives in the image. This means that, after correction, we can be 95% confident that there are no false positives at all in our image. If we were to repeat our experiment multiple times, and correct our images each time with a FWER procedure, we would only expect 5% of those repeats to contain *any* false positives. So, most of the time we can be pretty confident that any results that survive a FWE-correction procedure are *true positives*. This is illustrated in {numref}`poldrack-fwe-thresh-fig` from [Poldrack, Mumford and Nichols (2011)](https://www-cambridge-org.manchester.idm.oclc.org/core/books/handbook-of-functional-mri-data-analysis/8EDF966C65811FCCC306F7C916228529#), where controlling the FWER at 10% leads to only 1/10 repeats showing any false positives. However, we should also note what this had done to our ability to see the true positives within the yellow circle.\n",
