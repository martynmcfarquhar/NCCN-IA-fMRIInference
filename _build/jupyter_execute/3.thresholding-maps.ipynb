    "Before moving on, there is one important detail about how p-values are calculated for t statistics in SPM that we need to understand. When SPM calculates a p-value for an associated t-value, it only uses the upper-tail of the null distribution. What does this mean? Practically, it means that the t-values need to be positive in order for the p-value to be significant. As shown below, a negative t-statistic will always result in a large p-value, even though this represent the same magnitude of effect, just in the opposite direction. Technically, this makes any hypothesis test in SPM that uses t-statistics a one-tailed hypotheses.\n",
